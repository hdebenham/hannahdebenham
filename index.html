                <p>As a web designer for Summit Racing Equipment, I doubled as designer and developer. For Summit's full-site redesign, my role was to design a dynamic homepage that would allow the marketing team the ability to change content and format as they saw fit.</p>

                <p>To accomplish this task, I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for prototyping and mockups. I used HTML, CSS (Sass) and JavaScript, to build this page.</p>

                <p>I also worked on an internal project to redesign the company's order processing software. My role was to develop, conduct and analyze user tests.</p>

                <p>While working with Atech, I helped to update the website, both in design and tech. I was the lead designer for a partial-site redesign. Atech updated from a website available to view from the public to a customer-only access site. My role was to create a landing page that enticed potential customers and to simplify the application process. </p>

                <p>To accomplish this task, I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for prototyping and mockups. I used HTML, CSS (Sass) and JavaScript, to build these pages.</p>

                <p>Atech was a unique company to work with. As a B2B company, there were multiple user experiences to consider and the constraints of what could be shown to the customer differed from that of a B2C company. I really enjoyed working on this project.</p>
