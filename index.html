            <p class="section_head">A bit of background</p> 
            
            <p>I started working at a retail clothing store to save money while finishing school. As a sales associate, my number one job is to help the customer. Even in my brief time in retail, I can give you a glimpse at a conversation every sales associate has 50 times during a shift at work:
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote">
            Sales associate: Hello, how are you?
            <br>
	        Customer: Hi, I’m fine, thank you.
            <br>    
            Sales associate: What can I help you find today?
            <br>    
            Customer: I’m just looking…
            </p>
            
            <p>I’m just looking. It’s a mix of please leave me alone and I’m bored and thought I’d look around to pass the time. More often than not though, those customers will end their visit with either purchasing an item they found, putting an item on hold or saying they’ll probably order a certain item online.</p>
            
            <p>The idea for Tique came about for two reasons: 1. You don’t have to work in retail to see that many customers are taking their money and shopping habits online. 2. In my own experiences, I found that browsing online never felt quite as relaxing as walking through a store, just looking. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section_head">So, what's the problem?</p>
            
            <p>
            - Online retailers are approaching their online customers the same they approach their in-store customers. With help, help and more help.
            <br>
            - Customers want space, they're still just looking online, too!
            <br>
            - There's too many distractions online
            <br>
            - Just looking is fun and all... but in order for online retailers to survive, customers need to purchase.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section_head">What did I do to solve it?</p>
            
            <p>
            - User research! I know I said customers want space, but is that actually true...?
            <br>
            - Competitive analysis    
            <br>    
            - Sketching and wireframing and mapping it all out.
            <br>
            - User testing   
            <br>
            - Designed mockups
            </p>
            
            <p class="section_head">So, who are the users?</p>
            
            <div class="stat-wrap">
                <div class="stat"><h4>86.3%</h4>
                    <p>86.3% of users shop online on either a weekly of monthly basis.</p>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="stat"><h4>84%</h4>
                    <p>The users love Amazon. 84% listed Amazon as a site they use to browse products. 28% listed Pinterest and 46% listed specific company websites.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="stat"><h4>28%</h4>
                    <p>28% said they often purchase a product without prior intent to purchase that specific product. 56% they sometimes purchase products in this manner.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="stat"><h4>46%</h4>
                    <p>46% of users said they often will save a product to purchase later. 40% said they sometimes save a product to purchase later.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 240px">I made a user survey using Google Forms to find out the level of interest in online shopping. The survey also asked questions to determine online shopping habits. Overall, the survey received 51 responses. A few key responses: </p>
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you like most about the online shopping sites you use?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> I like that I can find items by categories
            <br><strong>A:</strong> easy to find, predicts what I need, easy checkout
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Variety of products
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you not like about the online shopping sites you use?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Too much to look at
            <br><strong>A:</strong> When you hit the back button and it takes you to the top instead of where you left off
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Ads, prices
            </p>
            
            <p>So, who are the users? I used the responses from the survey and created personas to better understand the users.</p>
            
            <div class="persona"><img src="../imgs/Personas-01.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-1"><img src="../imgs/Personas-02.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-2"><img src="../imgs/Personas-03.png"></div>
            
            <p class="section_head">Don't users already have a lot of options?</p>
            
            <p>After determining the users, I researched the competition. The three main competitors I analyized were Amazon, Pinterest and Etsy.</p>
            
            <p>Amazon has a lot to look at and a lot to buy. However, even with extensive navigation, the site can appear cluttered. Pinterest, on the opposite end of the spectrum, has a really clean design but not much functionality as you are unable to purchase products from the site.</p>
            
            <p>Etsy has a cleaner design than Amazon and the ability to purchase from the site, unlike Pinterest. The site promotes small businesses and individual creators, so that means there is no streamlined checkout process, which hinders usability.

            <p class="section_head">The Card: the answer to all my problems</p>
            
            <p>In order to achieve an in-store feel online, I developed user flows that would allow users to add items to their bag, or save an item, in one click.</p>
            
            <div class="center"><img src="../imgs/flowchart-cart.png"></div>
            
            <div class="img-wrap2">
                <div class="quarter left-marg left"><img src="../imgs/cart-sketch.JPG"></div>

                <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/card-wireframe.png"></div>

                <div class="quarter left-marg left"><img src="../imgs/card_single.png"></div>

                <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/card_multi.png"></div>
            </div>
            
            <p>By packaging each item in it's own card, the products become the focus of the design. I chose a card layout in order to encourage a more browsing-oriented experience. Users are able to make decisions directly from the homefeed, but also have the option to read deeper into the products.</p>
            
            
            <div class="img-wrap">
            <div class="center-left"><img src="../imgs/extended-view-sketch.JPG"></div>
            
            <div class="center-left"><img src="../imgs/extended-view-wire-1.png"></div>
            </div>
            
            
            <p>I initially thought I would have a standard description page found on most e commerce sites. However, after designing the card, I wanted the description page to be a cohesive design.  After user testing the wireframes, I found that users preferred to have the essential information higher up on the page. The description page is now an extended view of the card, which also gives related items for users to continue their search.</p>
          
            <div class="img-wrap-center">
                <div class="third left"><img src="../imgs/card_info_layout-wire-2.png"></div>

            </div>
            
            <p>With this project, I designed from the inside, out. After designing the card and extended view, I laid out the homefeed. That is what the user would initially see when browsing through products.</p>
            
            <div class="img-wrap-center">
                <div class="third left"><img src="../imgs/Homefeed2.png"></div>

            <p>As a way to encourage browsing, I decided to design the navigation within the flow of the products. This was mean't to reflect how you might find different "shops" within a store.</p>

            <p>In my initial usability testing with wireframes, I found that users preferred seeing a similar card layout in the checkout process. </p>
            
            <div class="img-wrap">
                <div class="center-left"><img src="../imgs/cart_A.png"></div>

            </div>
            
            <p>Below, the first design was my first attempt at a cart design. The intention was to not only keep the card design but also the four column layout found on other pages. In user testing though, multiple users responded that the design was awkward to look at. The second attempt still incoporates the card design and opportunities to keep shopping.</p>

            <p class="section_head">Well, what now?</p>
            
            <p>I'm really happy with how Tique turned out. Based off my initial creative vision and user testing, I think I was able to design a relaxing online shopping experience. </p>
            
            <p>If I had more time, I would like to go back and rework the cart design. I'd also actually take the time to build out this design and have a fully working prototype.</p>

            <p>When I first began working on this project, I though about how I would want the information displayed if I were the user. Links, notes and images all work differently on different scales. So, that mean't the site needed to be dynamic iin viewing options.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 240px">Using Google Forms, I made a survey asking potential users about their online habits. Overall, the survey received 36 responses. A few key responses: </p>
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you like most about your note-taking tools?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> I can access my google docs from anywhere. They never get lost.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Easy to remind myself without searching for a pen and paper.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Easy to access and is accessible across all devices.

            </p>
            
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you like most about your bookmarking tools?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> It saves everything and you can categorize the images you save.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Aggregate the files in folders.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Simple, bookmarked info is readily available.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> When I bookmark a link, it stays saved on my browser and I don't have to use Bing again!
    
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you like least about those tools?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Remembering I saved them there.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Not easy to see them all.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> The updated versions cost money.

            </p>
            
            <p>So, who are the users? I used the responses from the survey and created personas to better understand the users.</p>
            
            <div class="persona"><img src="../imgs/noted/blocbox-personas-01.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-1"><img src="../imgs/noted/blocbox-personas-02.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-2"><img src="../imgs/noted/blocbox-personas-03.png"></div>
            
            <p class="section_head">Don't users already have a lot of options?</p>
            
            <p>After determining the users, I researched the competition. The three main competitors I analyized were Box, Evernote and Google Drive.</p>
            
            <p>Box is a cloud-based storage product that focuses on its business clients. Box also puts an emphasis on file sharing, rather than storing small bits of information. Evernote is a note-taking platform, similar to what Noted will be. However, from the homepage it is unclear what the Evernote platform actually looks like and offers.</p>
            
            <p>Google Drive is the most popular of the competitors I researched. Google Drive files are saved similarly to how a file is saved on a computer, thus reducing any learnging curve.<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mMPSyZCOo4UGvFSyp1pYYHp1m2tY6OfbAN8JPdLejBM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
            
            <p class="section_head">Welcome to Noted.</p>
            
            <p>Before designing the mockups, I mapped out how a user would find their way around Noted. Then, I developed a brand identity for Noted.</p>

            <p class="section_head">Information is key</p>
            
            <p>For the homepage of Noted, I wanted to give users plenty of information about what the product offered. User testing the wireframes also showed that users better understood how to use the dashboard after reading through the homepage.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Initially, the dashboard was going to be laid out with a card layout structure. However, I decided to go with a design similar to Google Drive because it allowed users to easily read descripitions of each saved note. Users also had more organizational options with this layout.</p>

            <h3>About me</h3>
        </div>
            <p>I am a web designer who works with a journalistic eye and loves coding.</p>
            <div class="third right" style="height: 200px; background-color: black;"><img src=""></div>
            <p>I found my way to web design after a year and a half of studying journalism at Ohio University. I found that my interests were not as strong in writing as they were in how stories were presented to readers. With the field going digital, I began designing online stories for OU's student newspaper, <a href="thepostathens.com" target="_blank">The Post.</a> While studying journalism, I specialized in computer science and web design, which brings me to where I am today.
            </p>
            <p>I am finishing up the designer track at the design and coding bootcamp <a href="https://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc.</a> Bloc has equipped me with UX and UI design skills, as well as frontend developement skills.</p>
            <p>I'm available for work involving UX or UI design and/or frontend development. Check out my full resumé here.</p>
