            <p class="section">A bit of background</p> 
            
            <p>I started working at a retail clothing store to save money while finishing school. As a sales associate, my number one job is to help the customer. Even in my brief time in retail, I can give you a glimpse at a conversation every sales associate has 50 times during a shift at work:
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote">
            Sales associate: Hello, how are you?
            <br>
	        Customer: Hi, I’m fine, thank you.
            <br>    
            Sales associate: What can I help you find today?
            <br>    
            Customer: I’m just looking…
            </p>
            
            <div class="half right"><img src="../imgs/laptop_tique_3x.png"></div>
            
            <p>I’m just looking. It’s a mix of please leave me alone and I’m bored and thought I’d look around to pass the time. More often than not though, those customers will end their visit with either purchasing an item they found, putting an item on hold or saying they’ll probably order a certain item online.</p>
            
            <p>The idea for Tique came about for two reasons: 1. You don’t have to work in retail to see that many customers are taking their money and shopping habits online. 2. In my own experiences, I found that browsing online never felt quite as relaxing as walking through a store, just looking. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section">So, what's the problem?</p>
            
            <p>
            - Online retailers are approaching their online customers the same they approach their in-store customers. With help, help and more help.
            <br>
            - Customers want space, they're still just looking online, too!
            <br>
            - There's too many distractions online
            <br>
            - Just looking is fun and all... but in order for online retailers to survive, customers need to purchase.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section">What did I do to solve it?</p>
            
            <p>
            - User research! I know I said customers want space, but is that actually true...?
            <br>
            - Sketching and wireframing and mapping it all out.
            <br>
            - User testing   
            <br>
