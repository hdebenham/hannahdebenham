            <p class="section">A bit of background</p> 
            
            <p>I started working at a retail clothing store to save money while finishing school. As a sales associate, my number one job is to help the customer. Even in my brief time in retail, I can give you a glimpse at a conversation every sales associate has 50 times during a shift at work:
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote">
            Sales associate: Hello, how are you?
            <br>
	        Customer: Hi, I’m fine, thank you.
            <br>    
            Sales associate: What can I help you find today?
            <br>    
            Customer: I’m just looking…
            </p>
            
            <div class="half right"><img src="../imgs/laptop_tique_3x.png"></div>
            
            <p>I’m just looking. It’s a mix of please leave me alone and I’m bored and thought I’d look around to pass the time. More often than not though, those customers will end their visit with either purchasing an item they found, putting an item on hold or saying they’ll probably order a certain item online.</p>
            
            <p>The idea for Tique came about for two reasons: 1. You don’t have to work in retail to see that many customers are taking their money and shopping habits online. 2. In my own experiences, I found that browsing online never felt quite as relaxing as walking through a store, just looking. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section">So, what's the problem?</p>
            
            <p>
            - Online retailers are approaching their online customers the same they approach their in-store customers. With help, help and more help.
            <br>
            - Customers want space, they're still just looking online, too!
            <br>
            - There's too many distractions online
            <br>
            - Just looking is fun and all... but in order for online retailers to survive, customers need to purchase.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section">What did I do to solve it?</p>
            
            <p>
            - User research! I know I said customers want space, but is that actually true...?
            <br>
            - Competitive analysis    
            <br>    
            - Sketching and wireframing and mapping it all out.
            <br>
            - User testing   
            <br>
            - Designed mockups
            </p>
            
            <p class="section">So, who are the users?</p>
                <div class="stat"><h4>86.3%</h4>
                    <p>86.3% of users shop online on either a weekly of monthly basis.</p>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="stat"><h4>84%</h4>
                    <p>The users love Amazon. 84% listed Amazon as a site they use to browse products. 28% listed Pinterest and 46% listed specific company websites.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="stat"><h4>28%</h4>
                    <p>28% said they often purchase a product without prior intent to purchase that specific product. 56% they sometimes purchase products in this manner.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="stat"><h4>46%</h4>
                    <p>46% of users said they often will save a product to purchase later. 40% said they sometimes save a product to purchase later.</p>
                </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 240px">I made a user survey using Google Forms to find out the level of interest in online shopping. The survey also asked questions to determine online shopping habits. Overall, the survey received 51 responses. A few key responses: </p>
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you like most about the online shopping sites you use?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> I like that I can find items by categories
            <br><strong>A:</strong> easy to find, predicts what I need, easy checkout
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Variety of products
            </p>
            
            <p class="quote"><strong>Q: What do you not like about the online shopping sites you use?</strong>
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Too much to look at
            <br><strong>A:</strong> When you hit the back button and it takes you to the top instead of where you left off
            <br><strong>A:</strong> Ads, prices
            </p>
            
            <p>So, who are the users? I used the responses from the survey and created personas to better understand the users.</p>
            
            <div class="persona"><img src="../imgs/Personas-01.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-1"><img src="../imgs/Personas-02.png"></div>
            <div class="persona_thumb-2"><img src="../imgs/Personas-03.png"></div>
            
            <p class="section">Don't users already have a lot of options?</p>
            
            <p>After determining the users, I researched the competition. The three main competitors I analyized were Amazon, Pinterest and Etsy.</p>
            
            <p>Amazon has a lot to look at and a lot to buy. However, even with extensive navigation, the site can appear cluttered. Pinterest, on the opposite end of the spectrum, has a really clean design but not much functionality as you are unable to purchase products from the site.</p>
            
            <p>Etsy has a cleaner design than Amazon and the ability to purchase from the site, unlike Pinterest. The site promotes small businesses and individual creators, so that means there is no streamlined checkout process, which hinders usability.

            <p class="section">So, it's called Tique</p>

                <div class="center-left" style="transform: rotate(90deg);"><img src="../imgs/branding-logo.JPG"></div>
            </div>    
            
            
            <p class="section">The Card: the answer to all my problems</p>
            
            <p>In order to achieve an in-store feel online, I developed user flows that would allow users to add items to their bag, or save an item, in one click.</p>
            
            <div class="center"><img src="../imgs/flowchart-cart.png"></div>
            
            <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/cart-sketch.JPG"></div>
            
            <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/card-wireframe.png"></div>
            
            <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/card_single.png"></div>
            
            <div class="quarter left"><img src="../imgs/card_multi.png"></div>
            
            <p>By packaging each item in it's own card, the products become the focus of the design. I chose a card layout in order to encourage a more browsing-oriented experience. Users are able to make decisions directly from the homefeed, but also have the option to read deeper into the products.</p>
            
            
            <div class="img-wrap">
            <div class="center-left" style="transform: rotate(90deg)"><img src="../imgs/extended-view-sketch.JPG"></div>
            
            <div class="center-left"><img src="../imgs/extended-view-wire-1.png"></div>
            </div>
            
            
            <p>I initially thought I would have a standard description page found on most e commerce sites. However, after designing the card layout, I wanted the description page to be a cohesive design. The description page is now an extended view of the card, which also gives related items for users to continue their search.</p>
